# [Project 1: Spotify EDA and Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/lblake09/Spotify-EDA-Regressions.git)


In this project I cleaned, visualized, and used machine learning algorithms
to see if there is any correlation between a songs popularity
and its Spotifyâ€™s song metrics to have a better understanding of this
dataset. I also visualized each artists by gender every year from 2010-2019. 


# [Project 2: ECommerce Sales Analysis](https://github.com/lblake09/ECommeceSalesAnalysis.git)

Used pandas to perform to clean and visualize a dataset. Found the following trends: 
What was the best month for sales? How much was earned?
What city had the highest number of sales?
What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customers buying product?

# [Project 3: Senior Project](https://github.com/lblake09/Senior-Project.git)

In this project I analyzed, built, and fit models over the following datasets to compare trends
to form a conclusions:
- Cars MPG in the City vs. Highway
- Infections Rate Predictions in multiple hospital's
