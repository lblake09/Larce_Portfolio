# [Project 1: Spotify EDA and Multiple Linear Regressions](htps://github.com/lblake09/Spotify-EDA-Regressions)


In this project I cleaned, visualized, and used linear regression
model to see if there is any correlation between a songs popularity
and its Spotifyâ€™s song metrics to have a better understanding of this
dataset. Its safe to assume that since amount of users on Spotify has
seen exponential growth since the start of the decade (2010), the
platforms users has grown from a niche market to a more mainstream
market. Thus we see more accurate models in the later half of the
decade rather than the beginning.
